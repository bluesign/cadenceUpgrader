  // the case when we call the function with an ID that doesn't exist 
  // in the collection. In this scenario, we're forced to either panic 
  // or let a dereference error occcur, which may not be preferred in 
  // some situations. In order to prevent these errors from occuring we 
  // could write more code to check if the ID exists via getIDs() OR we 
  // can simply use the interface below. This interface allows nil to be
  // returned when the input ID does not exist allowing for a cleaner 
  // (and more efficient) way of handling errors.
